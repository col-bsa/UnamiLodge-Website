While you are always considered a member of the Order of the Arrow from the time of your induction, to be an “active member” your lodge dues must be paid annually. Paying your lodge dues supports the general operating budget of the lodge and gives more youth opportunities to participate in national programs. Being a dues paying member allows for you to participate in lodge events, wear the lodge flap proudly on your uniform, and ensures you receive updates and communications from the lodge. Click on the link below to pay your lodge dues and become an active member of Unami Lodge, One.
