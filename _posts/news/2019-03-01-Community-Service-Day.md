As some of you know, the lodgeâ€™s annual Community Service Day is coming up next month! On Saturday, March 30th members of Unami Lodge One, and Cradle of Liberty Council (Yes, it is open to non-OA members) are invited to attend community service projects at two locations within Cradle of Liberty Council. Service projects will consist of clearing brush, raking leaves, cutting branches, and cleaning up trash at one of the following locations

* Chester Creek Rail Trail (249 Knowlton Rd, Media, PA 19063)
* Mount Moriah Cemetery (6201 Kingsessing Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19142)
* Nor Gwyn baseball association (145 Hancock Rd, North Wales, PA 19454)

Check-in for the service projects will be between 8:30 and 9:00 AM, with the projects being finished around 3:00 PM. Please wear appropriate attire for the work projects. Anyone is more than welcome to bring their own yard tools. Lunch will not be provided, so individuals may pack a lunch or snack, or units that are attending together may have members volunteer to bring snacks. It would be a great help for any registered scouters to attend, and make sure you spread the word in your chapter or troop! Remember that the event is open to registered scouters outside of the Order of the Arrow, so encourage them to attend, as well.
