Brothers,

I’m very excited to be serving my brothers this upcoming year. I am currently a senior at MaST Community Charter School in Northeast Philadelphia, and I plan to pursue Finance in college. For the past four summers, I’ve had an incredible time working at Resica Falls Scout Reservation as an Ecology staff member and as a member of the OA summer crew. Serving on camp staff is definitely an unforgettable, rewarding experience. Through camp and my friendships in my troop, I found myself invested in the Order of the Arrow. I’ve learned that the Order of the Arrow is a completely unique organization that is truly youth led. We have so much in store for our newest members and for long-time Arrowmen!

Unami Lodge is a gateway to numerous opportunities for youth to grow, learn, enjoy themselves, and strengthen leadership skills. We have a tangible, positive impact on Scouting, the Scout Camps, our Council, and the community. It changed my outlook on Scouting and because of the OA, I’ve met some of my closest friends, and strengthened my already existing friendships. We have talented chapter chiefs, chairmen, and officers this upcoming year, who will give it their all and ensure our program is the best it can be! Be on the lookout for upcoming events! Our Spring Service 1 Weekend at Musser Scout Reservation is from April 12th-14th and the theme will be Carnival. I encourage the Scouts who joined our Order in 2018 to come out, you won’t regret it!

Yours in Brotherhood, <br>
Aidan Campbell <br>
