Earlier this year, the National Order of the Arrow Committee approved a change to the OA’s membership policy, permitting unit elections in Scouts BSA, Venturing, and Sea Scout units. These changes will take effect on February 1, 2019.

Over the next few months, lodge and unit leadership will likely be approached about these new changes. In order to secure a smooth transition into this new era, it is imperative that any information shared be accurate. Above all else, this is in the interest of ensuring that all of the BSA’s members are able to take advantage of all of the opportunities available to them.

The membership information page on the national website is an excellent resource to both refresh your memory and share with others who have any questions about these changes. Make sure to pay close attention to the “Requirements” and “News and Updates” sections.

You can access the membership information page at [oa-bsa.org/about/membership](http://oa-bsa.org/about/membership).
