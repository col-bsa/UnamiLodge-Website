Join us for the 103rd annual Lodge Dinner! Following dinner we will have awards presentations and the new lodge leadership inductions! There is a silent patch auction, and many other members will be there. It's a great time to join fellow brothers and enjoy catching up with everyone. There's no better time than the lodge Dinner to see all of your friends and enjoy a nice meal while congratulating those who got awards and those who were elected into lodge positions.
